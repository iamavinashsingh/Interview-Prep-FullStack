## Q1 :- What is JavaScript and how does it work in browsers?
- JavaScript is the language that handles the logic. It makes dead, static HTML pages alive, interactive, and dynamic.
- You use it to grab things on the screen and change them. For example, doing something when a user clicks a button:
```js
const button = document.getElementById('my-btn');
button.onclick = () => alert('You clicked me!');
```
- It’s the brain of the Frontend. And in the MERN stack, it’s the brain of the Backend too (Node.js). You basically write the whole app in one language.
- **JavaScript is the logic layer of the web that makes static HTML pages interactive and dynamic.**.
