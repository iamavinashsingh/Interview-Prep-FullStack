## Q1:- What is HTML and what is its purpose? 

### Ans :- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a system of "tags" used to label pieces of content so a web browser understands their role and relationship to one another. It is not a programming language; it is a structural blueprint.HTML works through a "Tree" mechanism. When a browser reads your code, it creates a Document Object Model (DOM). This is a parent-child hierarchy where every element sits inside another.
